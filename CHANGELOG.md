# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Label filtering in `determine_mode()` used jq `contains`, which does substring matching on strings; a label like `prd/feature-branch-workflow` was incorrectly treated as matching `prd` and excluded from the work queue. Replaced with `any(. == "label")` for exact equality matching on all three label checks (`prd`, `blocked`, `high priority`).

### Removed
- Redundant "Step 0 — Sync workspace" block from all mode files (`fix.md`, `force-approve.md`, `implement.md`, `merge.md`, `review.md`, `review-round2.md`); `ralph.sh` already syncs the worktree before building any prompt (#2)
